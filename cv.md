3. Hello. I am currently a student. My main education is an engineer in the oil and gas industry. While it is not yet time for adult life and everyday work, I want to try myself in another kind of activity, actually in programming (***front-end***), because I have always been attracted to *working in the network* and *working with my head*. I signed up for this course for the reason that I want to determine a specific vector of development, and not just rereading documentation and performing incomprehensible tasks. 
4. Basic knowledge of ***HTML***/***CSS***, little knowledge of ***JavaScript***, which, later, I hope to improve and consolidate with your help.
5. JavaScript code:
```JavaScript 
let name = "stanislav zlobin";
let upperName = "";
for (let letter in name) {
    upperName += name[letter].toUpperCase();
}
alert(upperName);
```
6. I have no experience in programming. Courses were studied ***Introduction to programming, HTML and CSS (layout), The Basics of Modern layout*** on [Hexlet site](https://ru.hexlet.io/categories/html/courses) and many similar ones on other sites.
7. My first education was *Bachelor's degree* at **Tomsk Polytechnic University** in the direction of ***Oil and gas business***. Graduated with a red diploma. The second, not yet completed, is *Master's degree* at **Mining University** in St. Petersburg in *the same direction*.
8. The level of English is ***pre-intermediate***. I am currently studying on my own according to the Murphy textbook. In plan to bring the level of English to automatism, because I understand that this is currently necessary.
